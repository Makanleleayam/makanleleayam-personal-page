![Alt text](/assets/Screenshot%202025-11-16%20220504.png?raw=true "Optional Title")
I style my page like a **terminal / command-line interface**, taking heavy **reference from Kali Linux’s aesthetic** the clean layout, hacker atmosphere, and minimal interface.

The **logo and color scheme**, however, are my own, based on my personal brand and custom design.  
It blends the Kali-inspired UI with my unique identity, creating a familiar yet original hacking-style experience.
